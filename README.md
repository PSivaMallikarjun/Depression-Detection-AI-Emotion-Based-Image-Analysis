# Depression-Detection-AI-Emotion-Based-Image-Analysis-
This project is about using AI to detect depression by analyzing facial expressions in images.

# How It Works:
Capture an Image:

A person’s photo is taken using a camera or uploaded from a device.
# Facial Emotion Analysis:

AI looks at the person’s face and checks for emotions like sadness, stress, or neutral expressions.
It uses machine learning to compare the face with thousands of other faces to recognize patterns linked to depression.
# Depression Score Calculation:

The AI gives a score based on how severe the depressive signs are in the image.
# Results & Recommendations:

If signs of depression are detected, the system can suggest actions like talking to a friend, relaxing exercises, or seeking professional help.
# Why Is This Useful?
Helps detect early signs of depression in people who may not realize it themselves.
Can be used in mental health apps, counseling services, and workplaces to check employees' mental well-being.
Encourages people to take action before depression gets worse.
# This project brings technology and mental health together to create a positive impact!
